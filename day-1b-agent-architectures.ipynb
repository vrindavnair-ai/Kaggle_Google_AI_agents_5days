      "The core benefit lies in **enhanced problem-solving through specialization**. Think of it as the ultimate divide and conquer strategy.

      "InitialWriterAgent > Elias polished the great lens, its beam cutting a steady swathe through the inky night. The sea, usually a familiar rumble, was hushed, expectant. He’d been keeper for thirty years, and the isolation had carved him into the rock itself. Then, a flicker at the tideline. Not phosphorescence, but a soft, internal glow. A rolled parchment, impossibly dry, lay nestled among the kelp. He unfurled it. Lines of light, intricate and alien, depicted constellations he’d never seen, dotted with emerald-green landmasses. A single, pulsing ruby marked a spot in the vast, dark ocean. It wasn't a map of any sea he knew. It was a map of somewhere else entirely.\n",
      "CriticAgent > The story is intriguing and sets a good mood, but it could benefit from a bit more development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are 2-3 actionable suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deepen Elias's internal reaction to the map:** While his isolation is mentioned, his immediate emotional or intellectual response to finding such an extraordinary object is brief. Show, don't just tell, his astonishment, confusion, or perhaps even a spark of hope or dread. For example, what specific thoughts race through his mind as he deciphers the alien constellations? Does he try to reconcile them with his known stars?\n",
      "2.  **Expand on the map's details and Elias's interpretation:** The description of the map is evocative, but it could be more detailed. What are the textures of the parchment? Are there any symbols or script besides the lines of light? How does Elias *know* they are landmasses and not something else? Consider adding a moment where he attempts to understand its purpose or origin, even if he fails.\n",
      "3.  **Hint at the *why* of the map's arrival:** The story leaves the reader wondering how and why this map appeared. While a full explanation isn't needed, a subtle hint or Elias's own speculation could add to the mystery and give the plot a stronger direction. For instance, does he consider if it was sent *to* him, or if it simply washed ashore by chance?\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias polished the great lens, its beam cutting a steady swathe through the inky night. The sea, usually a familiar rumble, was hushed, expectant. He’d been keeper for thirty years, and the isolation had carved him into the rock itself, a solitary sentinel against the boundless dark. His world was the predictable cycle of tides and the comforting, albeit monotonous, sweep of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, a flicker at the tideline. Not the fleeting dance of phosphorescence, but a soft, internal glow, persistent and beckoning. Curiosity, a sensation long dulled by routine, pricked at him. He descended the winding stairs, his boots echoing on the stone. Nestled among the dark, slick strands of kelp, lay a rolled parchment. It felt impossibly dry, impervious to the sea’s damp embrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "He unfurled it on the rough-hewn table in his lamp room. The parchment had the texture of aged vellum, yet it yielded and shone with an inner light. Lines of luminescence, intricate and utterly alien, crisscrossed its surface, depicting constellations he’d never seen. His astronomical charts, meticulously kept, held no record of these celestial patterns. Scattered amongst them were emerald-green landmasses, their shapes unfamiliar, unlike any continent or island known to man. A single, pulsing ruby, the size of a gull’s eye, was set in the very center of a vast, dark ocean, marking a singular point.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tremor ran through Elias, a mixture of awe and a disquieting unease. His mind, accustomed to the tangible realities of foghorns and storm warnings, struggled to grasp this apparition. Were these stars? Were these lands? The glow seemed to emanate from within the very substance of the map, as if it were alive. He traced the ruby with a calloused finger, a strange warmth radiating from it. It wasn't a map of any sea he knew, nor any sky he recognized. It was a map of somewhere else entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thousand questions, sharp and sudden, pierced his usual stoicism. How could such a thing exist? Who had made it? And why had it washed ashore *here*, at *his* lighthouse? He looked out at the dark, indifferent sea, as if expecting an answer. Was this a message? A lure? Or a cruel cosmic joke played on a lonely man? The isolation that had defined him for so long now felt less like a shield and more like a cage, and this map, with its impossible promise, had just rattled the bars. He carefully rolled the parchment, its glow softening but not extinguishing, and tucked it away, a secret burning in the heart of his solitary world. The beam of his lighthouse continued its sweep, but now, Elias knew, it illuminated more than just the treacherous waters; it guarded a mystery that had arrived from beyond the stars.\n",
